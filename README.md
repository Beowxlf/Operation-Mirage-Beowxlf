# Operation Mirage: Cyber Deception Portfolio

Operation Mirage is a hybrid honeynet and cybersecurity portfolio built to simulate adversary behavior, generate real log activity, and showcase practical detection engineering.

Every component — from system deployment to rule creation — is documented to demonstrate capability in building, securing, and operating a live, public-facing security environment.

---

## Mission Objective

Create a functional portfolio that:
- Emulates adversary techniques
- Captures endpoint and network telemetry
- Builds detections using real data
- Demonstrates readiness for SOC Tier 1 and detection engineering roles

---

## Stack and Tools

### Infrastructure
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- NGINX
- Cloudflared
- GitHub Actions

### Simulation and Monitoring
- MITRE Caldera
- Sysmon
- Wazuh
- Splunk
- SIGMA

---

## Key Sections

- `/index.html`: Public interface, threat feed, and portfolio layout
- `/projects/`: Tactical case logs based on MITRE techniques
- `/assets/`: Visuals and detection artifacts
- `/operation-documentation/`: Hardening, SSH lockdown, and tunnel setup

---

## Highlights

- Live threat feed populated by internal adversary simulation
- Case logs mapped to ATT&CK framework
- Secure tunnel architecture with firewall restrictions
- SIGMA rules created for detection logic
- All infrastructure built and maintained manually

---

## Roadmap

- 10+ MITRE technique walkthroughs
- Integrated Wazuh detection dashboards
- SIGMA repository and rule explanations
- PDF résumé and career page

---

## Deployment

URL will be added once final hardening and validation are complete.
